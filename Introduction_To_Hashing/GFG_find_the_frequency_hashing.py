# Given an array arr of positive integers and an integer x. Return the frequency of x in the array.

# Examples :

# Input: arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], x = 1
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Frequency of 1 is 5.
# Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1], x=2
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Frequency of 2 is 2.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= arr.size() <= 105
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 105
# 1 <= x <= 105

class Solution:
    def findFrequency(self, arr, x):
        freq = {}
        for num in arr:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        return freq.get(x, 0)
